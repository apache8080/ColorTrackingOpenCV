Vision Tracking in Java with OpenCV
====================

This repository is for my Synopsis Science Fair project in which I am using the web camera to control the mouse.


Included in this repository currently are test files in which I am testing how to use openCV for image processing. 

I have updated the final version of my object tracking experiments in java. In the ledObjecTrack.java file I can track an obejct of any color and then find its center ad have the mouse follow that center area.

Here is a link to a video of me testing the program: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8TVTaDCUTM
