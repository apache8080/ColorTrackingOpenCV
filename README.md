Synopsis_Sixth_sense
====================

This repository is for my Synopsis Science Fair project in which I am using the web camera to control the mouse.


Included in this repository currently are test files in which I am testing how to use openCV for image processing. 

Now the two best files to look at are the singleObjectTrack.java and multiObjectTracking,java.
In the single object tracking file I was able to track any shapes that are the color green. This allowed me to track a green hand but I need help on how to find joints on hands and do actual gesture tracking. 

The multi object tracking is still a work in progress since it can track red and green but is very slow.
