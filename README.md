Vision Tracking in Java with OpenCV
====================

This repository is for my Synopsis Science Fair project in which I am using the web camera to control the mouse.


I have updated the final version of my object tracking experiments in java. In the ledObjecTrack.java file I can track an obejct of any color and then find its center and have the mouse follow that center area. The Mouse.java is just a class I wrote that makes it easier for the program to interface with the on screen cursor.

Here is a link to a video of me testing the program: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8TVTaDCUTM
